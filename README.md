# LINEAR/SEQUENTIAL SEARCHING
Linear searching is a simple searching algorithm that traverses the entire list or array in a linear fashion, checking each element one by one until the target element is found or the end of the list 
is reached. It is straightforward but may not be efficient for large datasets.

In this Python code, the linear search function takes an array and a target value as input and searches for the target value in a linear or sequential manner. 
The example usage at the end initializes an array, specifies a target value, performs linear search, and then prints whether the target was found and its index if applicable.
